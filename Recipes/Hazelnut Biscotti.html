      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol class="instructions">
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
      <li>In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
      <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
      <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until a stiff dough forms.</li>
      <li>Fold in the chopped hazelnuts until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
      <li>Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet and shape it into a 12-inch long log, about 4 inches wide.</li>
      <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the log is firm and lightly golden.</li>
      <li>Remove the log from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 325째F (165째C).</li>
      <li>Transfer the cooled log to a cutting board and use a serrated knife to slice it diagonally into 1/2-inch thick slices.</li>
      <li>Place the sliced cookies back on the baking sheet and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until they are crispy and golden. Flip the cookies halfway through baking.</li>
      <li>Allow the biscotti to cool completely on a wire rack before serving. Enjoy the delicious Hazelnut Biscotti with your favorite hot beverage!</li>
