    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="ingredient-list">
      <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup powdered sugar, for rolling</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol class="instructions">
      <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the cocoa powder, granulated sugar, and vegetable oil until well combined.</li>
      <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
      <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
      <li>Add the dry ingredients to the cocoa mixture and stir until just combined. The dough will be thick and sticky.</li>
      <li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Place the powdered sugar in a shallow bowl. Roll tablespoonfuls of dough into balls, then roll each ball in the powdered sugar until coated.</li>
      <li>Place the coated dough balls on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
      <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the cookies have spread and the tops are crinkled. The centers will be slightly soft.</li>
      <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
      <li>Enjoy these delightful Chocolate Crinkle Cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite hot beverage!</li>
