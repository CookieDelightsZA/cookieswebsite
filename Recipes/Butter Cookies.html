    <h1>Butter Cookies</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="ingredient-list">
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol class="instructions">
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
      <li>Add the egg and vanilla extract to the butter mixture, and mix until well combined.</li>
      <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour and salt. Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, mixing until the dough comes together.</li>
      <li>Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a log, about 2 inches in diameter. Wrap the logs in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Slice the chilled dough into 1/4-inch thick rounds and place them on the prepared baking sheets, leaving a little space between each cookie.</li>
      <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy!</li>
