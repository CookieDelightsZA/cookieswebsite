    <h1>Almond Biscotti</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="ingredient-list">
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract</li>
      <li>1 cup whole almonds, toasted and roughly chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol class="instructions">
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
      <li>In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
      <li>Add the eggs, vanilla extract, and almond extract to the butter mixture and mix until well combined.</li>
      <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until a stiff dough forms.</li>
      <li>Fold in the chopped almonds.</li>
      <li>Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a log, about 12 inches long and 2 inches wide. Place the logs on the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between them.</li>
      <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the logs are firm and lightly golden.</li>
      <li>Remove the logs from the oven and let them cool for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 325째F (165째C).</li>
      <li>Transfer the cooled logs to a cutting board and use a serrated knife to slice them diagonally into 1/2-inch thick slices.</li>
      <li>Place the sliced cookies back on the baking sheet and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until they are crispy and golden. Flip the cookies halfway through baking.</li>
      <li>Allow the biscotti to cool completely on a wire rack before serving. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or tea!</li>
